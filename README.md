Programming Foundations: Intro to Git
Exercise files for the Programming Foundations: Intro to Git course on LinkedIn Learning.

This is where I am learning that the following:

1) git clone 
	-- this clones (copies) your repo locally by http (ssh will come later)
	-- check where you are in the dir structure as you cannot clone a repo into
		another repo


2) git add
	-- this add files/changes to the "Staging Area" of git
	-- the following controls how much gets staged
		git add -A  for all new/modified/deleted
		git add .   for all modified and new files
		git add -u  for all modified and deleted files
		git add <file>  for a specific file

#Save here then stage it 

Now push changes to the the remote repo
